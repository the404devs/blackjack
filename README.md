Jack Black's Blackjack, my first project from Grade 11 CS, as well as my first proper project ever.
It's a pretty decent and slightly glitchy game of Blackjack, written in C#.
The website we made with this project is lost to time. It was on Matt's site, and I don't have a copy of it.

Made in colaboration with Kevin, Matt, and Mitchell
